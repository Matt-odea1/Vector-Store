            <p>
              This AI tutor is part of a research project studying how course-specific AI assistants 
              support student learning in COMP9021. Participation is voluntary and you can choose to 
              use the tool without participating in the research study.

            <p>
              This study uses a mixed-methods research design, combining quantitative data (usage logs, 
              interaction patterns) with qualitative data (survey responses about your experience). 
              This approach helps us understand both <em>what</em> happens when students use AI tutors 
              and <em>why</em> it happens, giving a more complete picture of how these tools affect 
              learning, confidence, and academic integrity.
